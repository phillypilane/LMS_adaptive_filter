# lms_adaptive_filter

The Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm is one of the most successful algorithms. The algorithm is a gradient decent algorithm for finding the minimum of the performance surface. The LMS filter coefficients are adjusted from sample to sample in such a way as to minimize the the MSE. The LMS is at itâ€™s steepest descent when the weight factor is updated from the sample to sample.

The LMS algorithm is based on the estimations of the correlation matrix R and the cross-correlation matrix P. The LMS filter is a practical method of obtaining estimates of the filter coefficients h in real time without the complex matrix inversion of the Wiener adaptive filter.
